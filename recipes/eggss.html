    <h3>Scrambled eggs are a simple and delicious breakfast classic made by whisking eggs and cooking them gently until soft and fluffy. They’re creamy, comforting, and can be enjoyed plain or with your favorite mix-ins like cheese, herbs, or vegetables.</h3>
    <p>This dish is quick to make and perfect for busy mornings. Pair it with toast, avocado, or fresh fruit for a complete meal. Whether you like them soft and buttery or well-cooked and firm, scrambled eggs are a timeless favorite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2–3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional for creaminess)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese (optional)</li>
        <li>Chopped herbs or vegetables (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk until smooth. Add milk or cream if desired.</li>
        <li>Heat butter or oil in a nonstick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour in the eggs and let them sit for a few seconds before gently stirring with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Continue stirring occasionally, pushing the eggs from the edges toward the center as they cook.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly soft, remove from heat — they’ll finish cooking from residual heat.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and pepper, and mix in cheese or herbs if using.</li>
        <li>Serve warm with toast or your favorite breakfast sides.</li>
    </ol>
